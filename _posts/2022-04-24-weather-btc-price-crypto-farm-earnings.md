The goal of this notebook is to explore the relationship between weather, BTC price and crypto mining farms. The hypothesis is that weather conditions influence crypto farms and BTC prices.

For example, in cold weather, it is cheaper to cool crypto miners, especially those using Proof Of Work (PoW) algorithms. Cheaper operation costs translate to higher earnings for farms at the end of a year.

Any weather conditions that might affect the electricity grid will affect crypto farmers. For example, although beneficial to crypto mining operations, the abnormally low temperature might put a higher strain on an electric grid, thus causing grid operators to increase electricity prices or introduce a rolling blackout policy or something else. These control policies might decrease earnings for crypto miners and affect BTC prices.
