I started learning Poker seriously and as part of this effort generated a simple app to help me do this. I'm also trying to learn how Telegram web-apps are working, so I created an app that will be available on Telegram that helps you remember poker combinations. 
I'm sharing it with the world to do a basic idea validation and at the same time collect some feedback.

## What is Poker Gym?
Poker Gym is a free app available through Telegram where users can practice basic poker skills. For now, it only supports poker combinations. It will have more later.

## The Problem
Learning basics of poker is hard; you need to learn it through trial and error. What if you don't want to play couple of hundred games to get good at it and instead can drill those in an app?

## The Solution
Poker Gym lets you practice basics such as learning combinations and rankings.

## Features (Planned)
- Outs: Get familliar and drill counting outs (unseen cards that combine well with your cards)
- Progress tracking: See your improvement over time
- Leaderboard: See your place in relation to other players

## Looking for Feedback

If this sounds interesting to you, I'd love to hear your thoughts:
- Would you use a tool like this?
- What specific scenarios would you want to practice?
- What features would make this valuable for you?
